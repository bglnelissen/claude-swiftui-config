## Writing

- Use sentence case for all UI labels and descriptions. Use title case only for navigation titles and tab labels, following Apple's HIG conventions.
- Button labels should be short and action-oriented. Start with a verb: "Save", "Delete", "Cancel", "Add Item". Avoid vague labels like "OK" or "Yes" where a specific action name is possible.
- Write error messages in plain language. State what went wrong and what the user can do to resolve it. Avoid technical jargon or internal error codes in user-facing text.
- Do not use ellipsis ("...") in button labels to indicate a destructive or irreversible action. Use a confirmation dialog instead.
- Use an ellipsis in a button label only when the action opens another screen or dialog to gather more input before completing (e.g. "Share...").
- Keep placeholder text in text fields brief and descriptive. Do not use placeholder text as a substitute for a label.
- Avoid unnecessary filler words. "Tap to get started" can simply be "Get started".
