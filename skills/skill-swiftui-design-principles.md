## Design Principles

As you design interfaces for Apple platforms, keep these principles in mind:

- **Hierarchy**. Establish a clear visual hierarchy where controls and interface elements elevate and distinguish the content beneath them.
- **Harmony**. Align with the concentric design of the hardware and software to create harmony between interface elements, system experiences, and devices.
- **Consistency**. Adopt platform conventions to maintain a consistent design that continuously adapts across window sizes and displays.
